      "problem": "Kampoeng Koena is a newly founded tourism village as of early 2022. It has received support from the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (KPUPR) of Indonesia and aims to become a village with numerous homestays for tourists visiting nearby attractions such as Mount Bromo. However, <strong> the village faces the challenge of increasing the number of tourists while still promoting and preserving their local culture and experiences</strong>.",
      "solution": "After a three-day incentive involving interviews with locals, discussions with other groups, and brainstorming within our team, we arrived at a viable solution to help promote Kampoeng Koena: <strong> the creation of a website</strong>. In this digital age, where people rely heavily on the internet to search for information, a website can be a powerful tool to attract tourists to the village.<br /><br /> The website will be <strong> designed to showcase Kampoeng Koena's unique features </strong> and attractions, making it easy for visitors to plan their trip and learn about the village. To increase visibility, we will ensure that the website is <strong> optimized for search engines</strong>, making it easier for people to find when searching for travel destinations in the region."
